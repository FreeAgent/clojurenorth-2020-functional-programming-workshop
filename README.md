# Clojure Katas - Functional Programming (ClojureNorth 2020 Workshop)

There’s more than one way to solve a problem. This workshop is an opportunity to step out of your Clojure bubble and see how other Clojure developers approach and solve programming challenges.

In the first hour, participants will be tasked with solving 1 (or more) challenge problems, and in the second hour, we will review and discuss the various solutions.

There will be 4 problems, but each participant will only work on 1 (or 2 if there’s time), and then participate in the discussions for all 4. These problems won’t be “puzzles” that require discovering a particularly ingenious solution, but rather, reasonable-scoped “boring” tasks that have been designed to allow for varying kinds of solutions and showcase the strengths (or weaknesses) of Clojure and functional programming.

(For beginners to Clojure, you’ll be welcome to solve the problems in your preferred language, or attempt one of the simpler problems with Clojure).

1st Hour:
 - introduce format and problems
 - participants work on problems

2nd Hour:
 - participants submit their solutions for critique
 - review and discussion of solutions to each problem

## The Katas

Fork and clone this repository, then...

Start with *one* of the following:

 - [Birthday Greeting Service](/docs/birthday-greeting-service.md)
 - [Mars Rovers](/docs/mars-rovers.md)

If you have time, try *one* of the following:

 - [Bowling Score Calculator](/docs/bowling-score-calculator.md)
 - [Monty Hall Simulation Proof](/docs/monty-hall-simulation-proof.md)

For Clojure beginners, we recommend attempting the [Bowling Score Calculator](/docs/bowling-score-calculator.md).

After you're done with any of the exercises, if you'd like to have them potentially reviewed in Part 2 of the workshop, add a link to [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JwO53TlIj367CTodutJNvESWis0tIk4RJH8AiZoPsqs/edit?usp=sharing).
